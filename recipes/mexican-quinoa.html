        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sate jalapeno pepper and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute.
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                Stir black beans, tomatoes, corn, quinoa, and chicken broth into the skillet. Season with pepper flakes, chili powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil.
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                Cover the skillet with a lid, reduce heat to low, and simmer until quinoa is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed, about 20 minutes.          
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
                Add avocado, lime juice, and cilantro; stir until combined.
        </ul>
