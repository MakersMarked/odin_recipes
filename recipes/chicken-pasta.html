        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ounces boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup red wine</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano, undrained</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                Season the chicken as desired. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned, stirring often. Remove the chicken from the skillet.
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                Add the onion to the skillet and cook until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Add the wine and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                Stir in the tomatoes, Swanson Chicken Broth, penne, and water; heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook for 10 minutes or until the penne is tender, stirring occasionally. Return the chicken to the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the spinach and cook for 1 minute or until the spinach is wilted.

        </ul>
